Disable Comments - easy tool to disable comments for your blog posts, and pages. Admin can disable comments in just a few clicks. Delete comments from the blog post. 

== Description ==

The Disable Comments RB Plugin is a valuable tool for administrators seeking to completely disable comments on their website. Our plugin offers global disabling functionality, effectively removing all comment-related features and options across posts, pages, and attachments. With a focus on simplicity and power, our plugin streamlines the process of managing comments by employing a smart algorithm.

By installing and enabling our plugin, administrators can seamlessly eliminate comment-related elements from the Dashboard, Widgets, and Admin menu. This ensures a clutter-free interface and a smoother user experience for both administrators and visitors alike.

However, if you have specific sections of your website where comments are desired, our plugin offers the flexibility to selectively disable comments. Rather than globally disabling commenting, administrators can choose to deactivate this functionality only in the necessary areas of their WordPress site.

For those unsure of how to disable comments on individual posts or pages, our support team is readily available to provide assistance. Additionally, our FAQ section offers comprehensive guidance on navigating the plugin's features and settings.

Whether you seek to globally disable comments or selectively manage commenting functionality, the Disable Comments RB Plugin offers a versatile solution tailored to meet your website's needs.
